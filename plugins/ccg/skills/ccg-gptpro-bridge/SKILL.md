# CCG GPT Pro Manual Bridge

This manual bridge lets the user manually ask ChatGPT Pro inside a Codex-led CCG workflow.

Codex remains final owner. Gemini evidence mode depends on the command: required gate evidence for plan/review, and optional frontend/full-stack evidence for execution companion. GPT Pro provides a user-mediated manual second opinion.

## Hard Boundaries

- Do not automate ChatGPT web login.
- Do not submit prompts to ChatGPT web automatically.
- Do not read ChatGPT web DOM.
- Do not extract ChatGPT Output programmatically from the web UI.
- Do not store ChatGPT cookies, sessions, or account tokens.
- Do not bypass rate limits, restrictions, or protective measures.
- Codex remains final owner.
- GPT Pro output is untrusted helper evidence only.
- GPT Pro does not write workspace files.

## Manual Question Budget

Each GPT Pro bridge command is designed to complete in one manual ChatGPT Pro question.

- Expected manual questions: 1.
- Maximum manual questions: 2.
- Round 2 only for blocker re-check, revised plan comparison, applied diff review, or high-risk follow-up.
- More than two manual questions means the task should be decomposed or returned to Codex-native CCG workflows.

## Gemini Evidence Modes

Gemini and GPT Pro remain helper evidence only; Codex makes the final decision.

- For `/ccg:gptpro-plan` and `/ccg:gptpro-review`, keep the Codex + Gemini + GPT Pro plan/review flow: Run Gemini before GPT Pro and keep the Gemini Gate Before GPT Pro requirement.
- For `/ccg:gptpro-exc`, Gemini is conditional frontend evidence only: backend-only tasks should omit it, while frontend/full-stack tasks should use the bundled Gemini preview helper with `--prompt-template frontend`.
- After the user saves GPT Pro output, synthesize Codex findings, Gemini evidence when present, and GPT Pro manual second opinion in Chinese; otherwise state that Gemini evidence was not used.

### Required Gate For Plan And Review

Before creating a GPT Pro manual prompt for plan or review modes, Codex must have:

- a successful Gemini helper launch through the bundled Gemini preview helper;
- a real `CCG_GEMINI_RESPONSE_FILE` path;
- a non-empty Gemini response read from that file;
- a concise Gemini findings summary derived from that response file.

If required Gemini evidence fails, does not produce a response file, or writes an empty response, stop in Chinese and do not create a GPT Pro bridge session, and do not invent Gemini findings.

Use the helper-level gate arguments for required gate sessions:

```text
--gemini-policy required --gemini-evidence-role gate --gemini-response-file <CCG_GEMINI_RESPONSE_FILE> --gemini-summary-file <file-with-concise-summary>
```

Use `--gemini-summary "<summary>"` only for short diagnostic or fixture calls. The helper injects Gemini Gate Evidence into `prompt.md` and records `gemini_evidence.policy=required`, `role=gate`, `available=true`, `response_file`, `response_non_empty`, `response_chars`, `response_sha256`, and `summary` under `status.json` as auditable provenance.

### Optional Frontend Evidence For Execution Companion

For `/ccg:gptpro-exc`, use optional frontend evidence. Backend-only execution-companion sessions should omit Gemini evidence. Frontend/full-stack sessions should pass real Gemini frontend prototype evidence when it is available:

```text
--gemini-policy optional --gemini-evidence-role frontend-prototype
```

If a frontend/full-stack task has Gemini output, also pass `--gemini-response-file <CCG_GEMINI_RESPONSE_FILE> --gemini-summary-file <summary-file>`. The helper injects Gemini Frontend Prototype Evidence into `prompt.md`. If no Gemini evidence is provided, the helper records `gemini_evidence.available=false` and still creates the manual bridge session.

## Project Access Context

The helper should include project metadata in every GPT Pro prompt:

- local project name;
- sanitized repository URL, when detected from Git or provided with `--repo-url`;
- current branch and commit;
- whether local git status is clean or dirty.

GitHub links are useful but not sufficient by themselves. The repository URL is optional context, not the source of truth.

- If GPT Pro can use ChatGPT GitHub connector, Deep Research, or browsing, it may inspect the repository URL and cite exact file paths or commits.
- If GPT Pro cannot access the repository URL, it must not guess repository facts.
- Pasted CCG input, Gemini evidence when provided, diffs, and file excerpts have priority over repository content because local uncommitted changes may not exist on GitHub.
- The helper must sanitize repository URLs before including them in prompts or `status.json`; never include credentials, access tokens, cookies, or local filesystem paths as repository URLs.

## Workflow

1. Build a prompt using the selected mode template.
2. Write `status.json`, `round-1/prompt.md`, and `round-1/response.md`.
3. Launch the local bridge page when the user needs an interactive page.
4. The preview page may copy the prompt through browser clipboard APIs only.
5. The user manually pastes prompt into ChatGPT Pro.
6. The user manually sends the prompt.
7. The user manually copies ChatGPT Pro response.
8. The user manually pastes it into the bridge page or `response.md`.
9. Codex reads `response.md`.
10. Codex summarizes and decides next steps in Chinese.

## Manual Handoff Barrier

After creating a GPT Pro bridge session, Codex must stop at a manual handoff barrier.

- Run `scripts/gptpro_bridge.py` with `--detach-preview --open-preview` plus the mode-appropriate Gemini evidence arguments for round 1 sessions.
- Add `--repo-url <repository-url>` only when Codex needs to override the detected Git remote URL.
- Follow-up sessions may pass fresh Gemini evidence with the same arguments, or inherit the existing `gemini_evidence` provenance from round 1.
- Do not paste the full generated prompt into chat during normal handoffs.
- Show the preview URL, session directory, prompt file path, response file path, and status file path.
- Tell the user to open the preview page and use the preview page Copy Prompt button, or open `prompt.md` if the browser copy button fails.
- Tell the user to manually paste the prompt into ChatGPT Pro, manually send it, manually copy the output, and manually save it in the local bridge page or `response.md`.
- End the current assistant turn immediately after the manual handoff instructions. Do not continue planning, reviewing, executing, summarizing GPT Pro findings, or claiming the GPT Pro bridge is complete in the same turn.
- On a later turn, continue only after `status.json` shows `response_saved=true` and `response.md is non-empty`.
- If `response_saved=true` but `response.md is non-empty` is false, treat the bridge as incomplete and ask the user to save a non-empty manual response.

## Script

Use `scripts/gptpro_bridge.py`. The script creates local artifacts and exposes only localhost endpoints:

- `GET /`
- `GET /state`
- `POST /save-response`
- `POST /mark-copied`

It may open `https://chatgpt.com/` in a browser as a convenience. It must not automate ChatGPT web login, prompt submission, DOM extraction, or output extraction.

Use `--detach-preview` for normal skill-driven handoffs so the helper prints the local URL and returns while the localhost page remains available for the user's manual response.

Use `--print-prompt` only for diagnostics, fixtures, or explicit debugging requests, not for normal user-facing handoffs.
