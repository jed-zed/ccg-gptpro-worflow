# CCG Doctor

Run the read-only doctor and summarize it in Chinese.

## Invocation

Resolve the doctor script relative to this skill:

```text
skills/ccg-doctor/SKILL.md -> ../../scripts/doctor.ps1
```

Default command:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "<plugin-root>\scripts\doctor.ps1" -Verbose
```

If the user asks for JSON or machine-readable output:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "<plugin-root>\scripts\doctor.ps1" -Json
```

If the user explicitly asks to check Gemini model availability, add `-CheckGeminiModel`. Use `-GeminiModel <model>` only when the user names a model; otherwise doctor checks the configured default model:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "<plugin-root>\scripts\doctor.ps1" -CheckGeminiModel -GeminiModel gemini-3.1-pro-preview -Verbose
```

The model probe uses Gemini CLI `--skip-trust` so availability diagnostics do not stall on workspace trust prompts.

If the user invokes `/ccg:doctor --fix`, first determine whether the current workspace is the `ccg-codex-workflow` source checkout by checking for `plugins/ccg/.codex-plugin/plugin.json` and `scripts/sync-local-plugin-cache.ps1`.

- In the source checkout, run:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "<plugin-root>\scripts\doctor.ps1" -PluginRoot "<repo-root>\plugins\ccg" -Fix -Verbose
```

- Outside the source checkout, stay read-only. Run the normal doctor command without `-Fix`, then explain in Chinese that automatic cache repair requires the source checkout because fixing uses `sync-local-plugin-cache.ps1` as the trusted source.

## Reporting

- If `FAIL > 0`, lead with the failed checks and concrete repair suggestions.
- If there are no failures but `WARN > 0`, say the base plugin is usable and explain optional/degraded items.
- If everything is PASS/SKIP, say the plugin diagnostics passed and note any skipped checks.
- Mention that doctor checks prompt-visible skills and local file state. It cannot prove Codex TUI slash autocomplete.

## Boundaries

- Default doctor remains read-only and must not modify `.codex`.
- With `--fix`, only refresh the local CCG plugin cache from the source checkout. Do not install or remove command bridge files.
- Do not install or uninstall the command bridge.
- Do not call Gemini or run a real model request unless the user explicitly asks for `--check-gemini-model` or equivalent model availability diagnostics.
- Do not change repository files while handling `/ccg:doctor`.
