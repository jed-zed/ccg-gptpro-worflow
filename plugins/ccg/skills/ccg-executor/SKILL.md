name: executor
description: Run the CCG workflow inside Codex. Use when the user invokes /ccg, /ccg:workflow, /ccg:execute, /ccg:excute, /ccg:codex-exec, asks Codex to execute a .codex/ccg/plans/*.md or legacy .claude/plan/*.md file, or wants Codex to orchestrate Gemini while implementing a CCG plan.

# CCG Executor

You are the Codex-side orchestrator for CCG workflow plans. New plans are produced by `/ccg:plan` under `.codex/ccg/plans/`; legacy Claude CCG planning files under `.claude/plan/` remain readable compatibility inputs. Codex owns execution, final code edits, verification, and delivery. Gemini is an auxiliary coding/review partner for backend work, but Gemini is mandatory for frontend/UI prototypes and frontend/UI post-change review.

## Hard Boundaries

- Do not modify the original Claude CCG plugin under `~/.claude/commands/ccg`, `~/.claude/.ccg`, or `~/.claude/skills/ccg`.
- Do not call `~/.claude/bin/codeagent-wrapper.exe` or use Claude execution quota.
- Do not let Gemini directly own the workspace. Gemini should provide analysis, Unified Diff Patch prototypes, tests, or review notes; Codex applies final edits and verifies them.
- Treat Gemini diffs as dirty prototypes. Codex must refactor them into the repository's local style before applying, never paste them into the real workspace unchecked.
- Every Gemini call in the CCG workflow must use the bundled preview helper `scripts/invoke_gemini_preview.py`, which opens a browser preview by default. `/ccg:gemini-preview` is only a manual smoke-test/debug entry, not the only path that shows the preview.
- Do not call the raw `gemini`, `gemini.cmd`, or `gemini.exe` CLI directly for `/ccg:plan`, `/ccg:execute`, `/ccg:review`, or workflow-internal delegation. The only exception is `/ccg:doctor --check-gemini-model`, which performs an explicit availability probe.
- Preserve existing user changes. Inspect `git status` before edits and work around unrelated dirty files.
- Communicate with the user in Chinese. Tool prompts and external documentation queries may be English.
- Prefer `mcp__ace-tool__search_context` as the primary semantic code search tool when the user has configured ace-tool globally. Use `mcp__fast-context__fast_context_search` as a supplement when ace-tool is unavailable or insufficient. If ace-tool, fast-context, or `rg` fail because credentials are missing or access is denied, fall back to PowerShell-native exact search and targeted file reads; do not abort only because an optional search backend is unavailable.

## Architecture Shift

The original CCG model was:

```text
Claude Code orchestrates Codex + Gemini
```

In Codex, the model is:

```text
Codex creates plans, orchestrates Gemini, applies code, verifies, and reports
Legacy Claude CCG plans may still be executed as input artifacts
```

When an old plan mentions `CODEX_SESSION`, `GEMINI_SESSION`, or Claude-driven handoff files, treat them as provenance and intent, not as sessions to resume. If the old workflow says Claude should dispatch subagents, translate that into Codex actions: local context search, optional Gemini read-only help, Codex edits, Codex verification.

## Input Handling

1. Treat the command argument as either:
   - a plan path, usually `.codex/ccg/plans/<task>.md` or a legacy `.claude/plan/<task>.md`; or
   - a direct task description.
2. If it is a plan path, read the file and extract:
   - title and task type;
   - implementation steps;
   - key files and expected operations;
   - acceptance criteria and test commands;
   - any `CODEX_SESSION` / `GEMINI_SESSION` notes, for context only.
3. If it is a direct task description and no clear plan exists, ask for the plan path unless the user explicitly says to execute without a plan.
4. If the plan includes frontend, UI, styling, layout, component, accessibility, or responsive work, mark that slice as Gemini-first before Codex implements it.
5. If the plan involves costly ML training, GPU jobs, destructive data writes, or production deployment, implement code and smoke tests only; do not start expensive or destructive runs without explicit confirmation.

## Gemini Delegation Policy

Use Gemini as a helper, not as the executor of record. Every Gemini call in the CCG workflow must use the bundled preview helper and therefore should open the browser preview automatically unless the user explicitly requested headless execution.

- Backend-heavy tasks: Gemini is optional. Use it for edge-case review, API design alternatives, test ideas, or a second-pass diff review when risk is meaningful.
- Pure backend/simple tasks: do not spend time delegating unless the plan asks for it or the logic is risky.
- Frontend/UI tasks must use Gemini first with `--prompt-template frontend` or `--prompt-template prototype`, and the prompt must request a Unified Diff Patch prototype only. Do not accept a component sketch as the implementation prototype.
- Cross-cutting tasks: split the problem. Codex keeps ownership of backend, data, API contracts, migrations, shared schemas, and verification; Gemini produces the frontend/UI prototype or review only.
- Failed Gemini call: retry at most twice for frontend/UI work. If Gemini still does not provide usable output, stop and report the failure instead of silently falling back to Codex-only. For backend-heavy work, continue Codex-only and report the skipped delegation if relevant.

Recommended safe Gemini invocation:

```powershell
python "<path-to-this-skill>\scripts\invoke_gemini_preview.py" --workdir "<repo-abs-path>" --model gemini-3.1-pro-preview --prompt-template review --prompt-file "<prompt-file>"
```

Resolve `<path-to-this-skill>` from this `SKILL.md` directory. This helper creates a disposable snapshot of the workspace by default, starts a localhost browser preview, streams Gemini `stream-json` output into the page, and writes the raw output under `~/.codex/ccg/logs/`. It mirrors the original CCG `codeagent-wrapper` Web UI behavior without calling the Claude-side wrapper.

`/ccg:gemini-preview` is a convenience command for manual tests and one-off helper prompts. It does not change the rule above: when `/ccg:plan`, `/ccg:execute`, or `/ccg:review` decides to use Gemini internally, launch this same preview helper directly and let it open the browser.

Gemini prompts must use the bundled standard templates in `templates/gemini/`. They are adapted from the original CCG role prompts and command templates, but rewritten for Codex-native orchestration:

| Template | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `general` | Default bounded analysis, edge cases, and test ideas |
| `plan` | `/ccg:plan` read-only planning analysis |
| `prototype` | Draft implementation as a Unified Diff Patch dirty prototype |
| `review` | Bounded second-pass code review |
| `frontend` | UI, UX, accessibility, responsive, and component Unified Diff prototype or review |
| `analyzer` | Read-only architecture, codebase, risk, and option analysis |
| `architect` | Backend/API/data-flow architecture alternatives |
| `debugger` | Root-cause hypotheses, reproduction strategy, and regression tests |
| `optimizer` | Performance, reliability, complexity, and maintainability tradeoffs |
| `tester` | Edge cases, fixture strategy, and test-gap review |

Use `--prompt-template <name>` for every Gemini helper call. Use `--prompt-template none` only for debugging the helper itself.

The disposable snapshot excludes common secret files and credential directories such as `.env`, `.env.*`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.p12`, `*.pfx`, `id_rsa`, `id_ed25519`, `.aws`, `.gcp`, and `.azure`. The helper prints `CCG_GEMINI_SNAPSHOT_PATH`, `CCG_GEMINI_SNAPSHOT_EXCLUDES`, copied file/byte counts, and skipped categories; if a task truly needs one of those files, ask the user for a sanitized excerpt instead of copying secrets into Gemini context. For large repositories, prefer `.ccgignore`, `--respect-gitignore`, `--max-snapshot-bytes`, `--max-snapshot-files`, or `--files-from` rather than weakening secret exclusions.

Use `--no-browser` only for quick smoke tests or when the user explicitly wants headless execution. For long-running background delegation, add `--detach`; the parent process now reserves the preview port, waits for the preview server, opens the browser itself, and prints `CCG_GEMINI_PREVIEW_URL`, `CCG_GEMINI_BROWSER_OPENED`, `CCG_GEMINI_PREVIEW_PID`, `CCG_GEMINI_OUTPUT_FILE`, `CCG_GEMINI_RESPONSE_FILE`, `CCG_GEMINI_LAUNCHER_LOG`, `CCG_GEMINI_PROMPT_TEMPLATE`, and `CCG_GEMINI_AUTO_CLOSE_BROWSER_SECONDS`. The browser preview shows live process events, parsed Gemini output, and raw stream-json/debug output while Gemini runs. It attempts to close itself after completion, defaulting to 3 seconds; use `--no-auto-close-browser` only when the user wants to keep the preview open. Later read the response file before acting on Gemini's suggestions. Use `--direct-workdir` only when the user explicitly accepts that Gemini may touch the real workspace.

Gemini task prompts should include only the task-specific payload because the helper prepends the standard CCG template:

- task goal and relevant plan excerpt;
- exact files or snippets to inspect when available;
- a request for concise output: analysis, unified diff, test cases, or review findings;

## Execution Workflow

### Phase 0: Preflight

- Run `git status --short`.
- Read project instructions (`AGENTS.md`, relevant project docs, and any plan-linked notes).
- Summarize the plan internally as scope, files, tests, and risks.
- For substantial tasks, maintain a task checklist and update it as work progresses.
- Decide whether Gemini assistance is useful and state that decision briefly in Chinese if the task is substantial.

### Phase 1: Context Search

- Use ace-tool first with a query built from the plan title, key files, domains, and symbols.
- Read the specific files needed after semantic search identifies them.
- Use exact search only for known identifiers, filenames, or error messages.
- If the plan references current library/API behavior, use Context7 or official docs before coding.
- Keep context focused on files that affect the implementation.

### Phase 2: Optional Gemini Assistance

- Build a narrow prompt from the current plan and local code context.
- Prefer asking for one of:
  - an implementation outline for backend-only work;
  - a focused unified diff for backend or frontend work;
  - missing edge cases/tests;
  - review findings on a specific diff.
- Treat Gemini output as untrusted suggestions. Codex must adapt it to local patterns and run verification.
- For frontend/UI implementation, this phase is required before edits. Ask Gemini for a Unified Diff Patch prototype only with `--prompt-template frontend` or `--prompt-template prototype`, then treat the result as a dirty prototype that Codex rewrites before applying.

### Phase 3: Implementation

- Implement directly in Codex using the repository's existing patterns.
- Prefer small, focused edits and existing helpers.
- Use tests first when the plan includes clear behavior or bugfix acceptance criteria; otherwise add focused tests in the most local existing test style.
- Use `apply_patch` for manual file edits.
- Do not rewrite plan files, handoff files, or original CCG workflow files as part of execution unless the user explicitly asks.

### Phase 4: Verification

- Run the narrowest relevant verification first:
  - backend TypeScript: workspace typecheck and focused tests;
  - Python/ML service: focused pytest or the script's smoke mode;
  - contracts/shared schemas: affected package tests/typecheck;
  - frontend touched incidentally: typecheck and focused component tests.
- Apply CCG quality gates when they match the scope:
  - `/ccg:verify-change` and `/ccg:verify-quality <changed-path>` for changes over roughly 30 lines or risky refactors;
  - `/ccg:verify-module <module-path>` for newly created modules;
  - `/ccg:verify-security <changed-path>` for auth, permission, validation, secrets, file upload, command execution, or network-boundary changes.
- If full verification is too slow or blocked by local services, run a smaller meaningful check and report the blocker.
- Fix regressions caused by the implementation before delivery.

### Phase 5: Review

- Inspect `git diff --stat` and the full relevant diff.
- Check that every changed file maps back to the plan scope.
- For any frontend/UI diff, run Gemini review with `--prompt-template review` or `--prompt-template frontend` after Codex applies the local rewrite. Retry a failed Gemini review at most twice, then stop and report the missing review evidence.
- For large or risky backend diffs, use Gemini or a local Codex review/subagent for a bounded review pass, then independently verify the findings.
- Treat backend logic, data integrity, transactions, error handling, and tests as first-class review targets.

### Phase 6: Delivery

Report in Chinese with:

- what was implemented;
- changed files;
- verification commands and results;
- any blockers, residual risks, or manual follow-up.

Do not commit unless the user asks.

## CCG-Specific Notes

- A CCG plan's `SESSION_ID` section is for the old Claude-orchestrated workflow. In this Codex executor, use it only to understand provenance; do not try to resume those sessions.
- A plan may still say `/ccg:execute` as the launch command. Inside Codex, this plugin's `/ccg:execute` means direct Codex execution.
- `/ccg:excute` is preserved as a typo alias for muscle memory.
- `/ccg:ccg` and `/ccg:workflow` are help/index entries that should route the user into this Codex-native workflow.
- Respect each repository's local `AGENTS.md` and project-specific rules. When no stronger project rule exists, use ace-tool first if configured and fast-context second.

## Bundled Rule References

When the task needs more detail, read only the relevant rule file under `../../rules/`:

- `ccg-fast-context.md` for ace-tool and fast-context routing.
- `ccg-search-evidence.md` for web/search evidence standards.
- `ccg-quality-gates.md` for quality gate trigger rules.
- `ccg-skill-routing.md` for domain-oriented context routing.
- `domain-frontend.md`, `domain-backend.md`, `domain-security.md`, `domain-devops.md`, `domain-ai.md`, and `domain-data.md` for migrated original CCG domain guidance.
- `impeccable-ui.md` for UI polish and visual-risk guidance.
- `scrapling.md` for scraping/extraction safety boundaries.
